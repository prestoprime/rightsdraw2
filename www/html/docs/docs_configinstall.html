		<h2>How to configure and install  <i class="rd">RightsDraw</i></h2>
		<h3>Preparation</h3>
		<p>
The <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> sofware package is distributed in form tarball (tar.gz), and is expected to be installed on a Linux Ubuntu system. 
		</p>
		<p>
In principle the service can run on any Linux system, however the resolution of dependencies and the name of some utilities command may be diffent. If you intend to install  <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> on a system with a Linux distribution different from Ubuntu, you will need to modify the dependency check part of the configuration and you may need to create aliases to some commands.
		</p>
		<p>
You can unpack the tarball in any location of your filesystem, such as /opt or /usr/local, where the folder <i>rightsdraw2</i> will be created and will become the working directory of your  <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> services.
		</p>
		<p>
The ownership of the working directory and its path hierarchy will be given to the system user indicated in the initial configuration.
Write permission to some folders will also be given to the system user running apache web server. 
		</p>
		<p>
The configuration script requires the <i>tcsh</i> interpreter.
		</p>
		<h3>Configuration</h3>
		<p>
Before actually installing the software it is required to run the configuration script.
		</p>
		<p>
The configuration script will set a number of properties, the default values of which can be overwritten by indicating the desired option from the command line.
		</p>
		<p>
To run the configuration, execute the following commands from a terminal:
		</p>
		<p class="cmd">
$cd /&lt;yourpath&gt;/rightsdraw2<br/>
$./configure [OPTIONS]
		</p>
		<p>
For knowing the configuration options and their default values, just run:
		</p>
		<p class="cmd">
$./configure -h 
		</p>
		<p>
The configuration script will first run a dependency check. In case some package will result missing, the script will notify the problem and exit.
		</p>
		<p>
On success, the configuration will create the scripts for completing the installation and for the users administration.
		</p>
		<h3>Install / Uninstall</h3>
		<p>
The installation command must be given with administration privileges.
		</p>
		<p class="cmd">
$cd /&lt;yourpath&gt;/rightsdraw2<br/>
$sudo ./install 
		</p>
		<p>
Within the installation, a user named "default" is created. You will be required to set a password for this user and confirm it.
		</p>
		<p>
The user "default" is used also as a template for the creation of other users. Do not drop it.
		</p>
		<p>
To uninstall  <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> it is sufficient to run, as root:
		</p>
		<p class="cmd">
$cd /&lt;yourpath&gt;/rightsdraw2<br/>
$sudo ./uninstall 
		</p>
		<p>
The uninstall script just makes inactive the services to the http server but it doesn't remove the users files and the  <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> working directories.
