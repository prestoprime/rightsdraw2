		<h2>Purchases and sales</h2>
<p>
This context of <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> permits to update the rights holdings information according to an MCO Contract about the same IP-Entity.  
</p><p>
In case of purchase the rights holder is getting further rights issued by another party in the contract. The new incoming permissions are added to the rights holdings.  
</p><p>
In case of sale the rights-holder is acting as the <i>Issuer</i> in the contract, which, for being applicable must contain deontic expressions compatible with the holdings before the trade, i.e. the rights holder must have same or larger Permissions than issued ones, with sublicense right. If the sale is agreed on exclusivity basis, the rights holdings have to be updated in order to reflect the transfer of rights.
