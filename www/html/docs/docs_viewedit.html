		<h2>View and Edit</h2>
<p>
From this context the <i>User</i> has the possibility to create, view, and edit an <i>MCO Document</i> within his/her repository area. It is also possible to load and remove documents, and to get out copies of them in export. 
</p><p>
The repository area of the <i>User</i> is split into two sections, one for contracts and one for holdings (rights related to an archival item). A third section, available only to enabled users, is reserved for editing the <i>key patterns rights (KPR)</i>.
</p><p>
The normal working mode makes use of a graphical representation of the <i>MCO Document</i>, in which any entity individual is represented by an ellipse, the relationships between entities (Object Properties) are presented by arcs between two ellipses, and data properties of an individu7al are presented by gray boxes.
</p><p>
The diagram is itself an interface for modifying the <i>MCO Document</i>. When the <i>User</i> clicks on an ellipse, a number of forms are returned into a browser frame, permitting editing activities depending on the class on the individual and on its current context.
</p><p>
The graphical working mode is available for all the repository sections, which differ only in the creation form  from the empty document.
</p><p>
Limited to the <i>holdings</i> section, the <i>User</i> can view and edit the <i>MCO Document</i> by means of an alternative interface based on the defined <i>key patterns rights (KPR)</i>. The <i>User</i> will add <i>Permissions</i> simply by selecting an already defined pattern and adding the specific exploitation constraints. The presentation is different too: a table shows, for each defined <i>key pattern</i>, if there are or not  matching <i>Permissions</i>, and for each of them it is possible to view which the specific exploitation constraints are. This working mode can be quicker for the <i>User</i> because he/she has fewer fields to fill and no mistakes are possible on the pre-defined patterns. On the other hand it is possible that the defined <i>key patterns rights</i>, while covering the most recurring cases, don't cover other relevant situations.
