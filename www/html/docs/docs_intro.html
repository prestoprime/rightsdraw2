		<h2>Introduction to <i class="rd">RightsDraw</i></h2>
		<p>
<i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> is a set of services for creating and handling documents according to ISO/IEC 21000-21, that is MPEG21 part 21, <b><u>Media Contract Ontology (MCO)</u></b>.
		</p>
		<p>
An MCO document in <i class="rd">RightsDraw</i> can be:
<ul>
	<li>a <b>Contract</b>, related to the exploitation rights of any set of audiovisual items, with indication of the contract parties, and optionally the inclusion of the narrative contract;
	<li>a <b>rights holding information set</b>, related to the hold exploitation rights regarding a specific audiovisual item, possibly derived from several contracts. 
</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
The services are <i>multi-user</i>, i.e. each user owns and manages his/her MCO documents. All users share a set of <i>key patterns rights (KPR)</i>, which can be defined in order to make some type of work easier. Only the authorized administrative users can manage the <i>kpr</i> area.
		</p>
		<p>
		<p>
<i class="rd">RightsDraw</i> doesn't provide a service of persistent repository, but it provides the means for interfacing with such systems, such as in the case of the services of the  <i>PrestoPRIME Preservation Platform (P4)</i>.
