<ul>
	<li>a <b>Contract</b>, related to the exploitation rights of any set of audiovisual items, with indication of the contract parties, and optionally the inclusion of the narrative contract;
	<li>a <b>rights information set</b>, related to the hold exploitation rights regarding a specific audiovisual item, possibly derived from several contracts. 
</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
