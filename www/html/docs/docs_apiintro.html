		<h2>Introduction to <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> APIs definition</h2>
<p>This chapter provides the details on the <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> APIs definition. <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> services are deployed on an http service (Apache) with CGI-BIN interfaces.</p>
<p>The HTML/GUI of <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> provides to the <i>User</i> the means to interact with the services.
The requests to <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> services can been divided between those for which an impact on the <i>User</i>'s resources on <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> (in terms of modifications to <i>MCO documents</i> or to  <i>User</i>'s settings) is expected and those which only return application data.
Regarding the format it must be noted that they are not all always idempotent.
 </p>
<p>The default output data format is <i>text/html</i> and is conceived to be presented to the <i>User</i> by means of the browser (e.g. Firefox).
Other used output data formats are: <i>text/plain</i>, to be expected for receiving execution results in terms of Success/Failure or item list, and <i>text/xml</i>, used for exporting <i>MCO documents</i>.</p>
		<p>
<i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> services can also be used by remote applications and other services, without human interaction or with a different GUI interface.
