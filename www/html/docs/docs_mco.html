		<h2>MCO services context</h2>
		<p>
From this context the <i>User</i> has the possibility to create, view, and edit an <i>MCO Document</i> with his/her repository area. It is also possible to remove documents and to get out copies of them in export.
		</p>
		<p>
The repository area of the <i>User</i> is split into two sections, one for <i>contracts</i> and one for <i>pprights</i> (rights related to an archival item). 
The <i>User</i> can select the working area from the <a href="docs_settings.html">settings section</a>. The document creation form is depending on which working area is in use.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating a Contract document</h3>
		<p>
For initiating a new contract document no input is required. A new MCO document, with an automatically generated filename, will be created with an empty contract individual.
		</p>
		<p>
By clicking on ellipse representing the contract individual, the <i>User</i> will get forms for adding other contract elements, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>Contract metadata, such as the contract date;
			<li>Contract Parties, either Organizations or Persons;
			<li>Deontic Expressions (Permissions, Obligations, Prohibitions)
			<li>The textual version of the contract (loading a TXT file)
		</ul> 
		</p>
		<h3>Creating a <i>pprights</i> document</h3>
		<p>
For creating a <i>pprights</i> document, the <i>User</i> has to provide an identifier of the <i>Intellectual Property Entity</i> which is going to be the subject, and the name, of the MCO document. Other information as <i>Title</i> or <i>Description</i> are optional and can be given later.
