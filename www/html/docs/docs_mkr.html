		<h2>Editing with <i>Key Pattern Rights</i></h2>
		<p>
This context of <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> is for creating and editing MCO <i>pprights</i> documents on the basis of the available defined <i>Key Pattern Rights (KPR)</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
This functionality is limited to MCO <i>pprights</i> documents.
		</p>
		<p>
The fact of using this service or subsequent modifications to the definitions of the <i>KPRs</i> don't impact the usability of the MCO document by other components, and viceversa.
		</p>
		<p>
For each defined <i>Key Pattern Right</i> the <i>User</i> can easily verify if  his/her MCO document matches it or not, apart the constraints normally associated to the exploitation context, such as Territory, License Period, Language, or Run.
		</p>
		<p>
The <i>User</i> can  add <i>Permissions</i> defined on the basis of the <i>Key Pattern Rights</i>, specifying the exploitation constraints.
		</p>
		<p>
Any <i>Permission</i> can also be removed.
		</p>
		<p>
It is important to notice that a single <i>Permission</i> can satisfy more than one <i>Key Pattern Right</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
From this context it is  also possible for the <i>User</i> to define a <i>Secondary Right</i>, which is a <i>Permission</i> that is restricted to the status of an <i>Action</i> permitted by another <i>Permission</i>.
