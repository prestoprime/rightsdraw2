		<h2>Applying Contracts to PPRights</h2>
		<p>
This context of <i class="rd">Rightsdraw</i> permits to update the Rights information about an archival item (<i>pprights</i>) according to an MCO Contract about the same IPEntity.
		</p>
		<p>
General pre-requisites to be verified are:
	<ul>
		<li>The two OWL documents must include the same <i>IPEntity</i>
		<li>One of the Parties in the Contract must be the <i>Rights Holder</i> of Permissions in the <i>pprights</i> documents
		</ul>
	</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
In case of sale, that is when the <i>pprights</i> rights-holder is act as the <i>Issuer</i> in the contract, it must be also verified whether the contract is applicable, i.e. that at least the issued Permissions must be owned, with possibility to sublicence.
		</p>
		<p>
In case of sale, the <i>pprights</i> have actually to be updated only if the Permissions issued in the Contract are issued with <i>exclusivity</i>.
